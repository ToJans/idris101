========

Goal
----

This is a learning project by a group of people interested in learning [the Idris language](http://www.idris-lang.org/), a functional programming language with [dependent types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type).

The goal would be to have [the bowling kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBowling) written in the Idris language by the time we go to [BuildStuff 2015](http://buildstuff.lt/), probably November 2015.

If it works out, we can all feel like Jean-Claude:

Social media etc
----------------

For now I don't see the added value of having a twitter account etc. I'd assume the hashtag `#Idris101` should be 
sufficient. Opinions are welcome!

Some further learning
---------------------

In case you'd want to get a feel of what we're trying to grasp, we've set up [a preliminary page with some video tutorials](https://github.com/ToJans/idris101/wiki/Video-tutorials) on the wiki.

(I've also created a blog post introducing this project [here](http://tojans.me/blog/2014/11/27/about-dependent-typing-idris-and-the-road-to-valhalla/), including some of [Andrew's code](https://github.com/ascjones/BowlingKata).)
